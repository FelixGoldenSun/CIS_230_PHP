# CIS 230 PHP 

This is a site that was made for my PHP class in college. It contains a calendar, a contact me page that sends email, and some working blog systems. The blog (Not the article or product one) also has comments and a rating system. The site is connected to a database that stores all of the comments. The site uploaded to GitHub wonâ€™t work with the database, but you can see the live version at cis230.benawalls.com.
